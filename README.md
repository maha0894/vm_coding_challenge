To use the service you must first create an empty db. Then, please specify url for the service and DB name and credentials in config.json

The quickest way to run it is using `go run`:

```sh
$ go run main.go
```

To produce a binary from your Go source that you can run as a standalone executable, without using go tool. Use `go build` for that, it will create an executable in the current directory.

#### Environment the service was tested on

OS: Windows 10
GO version: 1.15.4
